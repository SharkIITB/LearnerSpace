                    Football, known as soccer in some countries, is one of the most popular and widely played sports in the world. It involves two teams of eleven players each, competing to score goals by getting a ball into the opposing team's net.

                    <h2>History of Football</h2>
                    Football's history spans millennia, beginning with ancient ball games in civilizations like China, Greece, and Rome, evolving through chaotic medieval European forms. The modern game took shape in 19th century England with standardized rules established by the Football Association in 1863. The sport's professionalism began in 1885, leading to the formation of leagues and the global spread of the game. FIFA's founding in 1904 and the inaugural World Cup in 1930 marked key milestones, making football the world's most popular sport. The growth of women's football, technological advancements, and commercialization have further modernized and globalized the game.

                    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
                    Football, or soccer, is governed by a set of basic rules that ensure fair play and structure. The game is played on a rectangular field, typically 100-110 meters long and 64-75 meters wide, with markings including a center circle, penalty areas, goal areas, and corner arcs. Each team consists of 11 players, including one goalkeeper, and can make up to three substitutions during a match. A standard match lasts 90 minutes, divided into two 45-minute halves with a 15-minute halftime break, starting with a kickoff from the center circle. The objective is to score goals by getting the ball entirely across the opponent's goal line between the goalposts and beneath the crossbar. Players must adhere to the offside rule, which prevents them from being nearer to the opponent's goal line than the ball and the second-last opponent when the ball is played to them, unless they are in their own half. Fouls, such as tripping, pushing, or handling the ball, result in free kicks or penalty kicks, depending on where the offense occurs. Yellow cards caution players, while red cards result in a player being sent off. Restarts occur with throw-ins, goal kicks, or corner kicks, depending on how the ball left the field. Goalkeepers can handle the ball within their penalty area but must release it within six seconds. Players are expected to exhibit fair play and respect the game's spirit, with unsporting behavior like diving or time-wasting being penalized. These rules form the foundation of football, ensuring an organized and enjoyable game for players and spectators.
